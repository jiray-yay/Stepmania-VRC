# Stepmania-VRC
This project aims to recreate stepmania (https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania) into vrchat. It basically is a combination of a parser for sm files + visualizers and gameplay manager using the parsed data + virtual arcade pads.
This project uses Udon# (https://github.com/vrchat-community/UdonSharp)
## Adding songs
Each cab prefab has a "StepfilesManager", you need to fill the TextAssets and AudioFiles arrays by yourself. textAssets should be .sm files renamed as .sm.txt (because Unity can't recognize .sm as text assets and it's impossible to read a folder/files with Udon).
